Charlene's Coffee Corner
Recently, Charlene decided to open her very own little coffee shop on a busy street corner.
Being the careful entrepreneur, she decided to start off with a limited offering, with the option to expand her choice of products, as
business goes.
Her Offering
- Coffee (small, medium, large) 2.50 CHF, 3.00 CHF, 3.50 CHF
- Bacon Roll 4.50 CHF
- Freshly squeezed orange juice (0.25l) 3.95 CHF
  Extras:
- Extra milk 0.30 CHF
- Foamed milk 0.50 CHF
- Special roast coffee 0.90 CHF
  Bonus Program
  Charlene's idea is to attract as many regularâ€˜s as possible to have a steady turnaround.
  She decides to offer a customer stamp card, where every 5th beverage is for free.
  If a customer orders a beverage and a snack, one of the extra's is free.
